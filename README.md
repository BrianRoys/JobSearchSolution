# JobSearchSolution

This is a project I work on to keep my skills fresh as well as  help me track my job search efforts, keep track of opportunities and contacts (my spreadsheet is just not cutting it).

It is built with .NET Core (ASP.NET, MVC, Razor, Entity Framework, T-SQL, and CSS)
The database consists of three main tables; Opportunities, Events and Contacts. Each with a many-to-many relationship with each other which is database fun but Visual Studio didn't know hot to stub out the UI which was the real challenge.
